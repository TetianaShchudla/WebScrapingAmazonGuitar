## Hello!

In this project I am using _Jupyter Notebook_ for extracting needed information of a desired guitar on the Amazon Website.
These lines of codes can help to check the guitar details and its updates in different criterias, including changes in price.

Link to the product: 
[Guitar to buy](https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-Easy-Teaching-Guitar-EZ-AG/dp/B000MSOBXC/ref=sr_1_25?crid=WYDOP351PWOP&keywords=guitar&qid=1667683236&refinements=p_89%3AYAMAHA&rnid=2528832011&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=guitar+%2Caps%2C393&sr=1-25).

I hope you enjoy.
